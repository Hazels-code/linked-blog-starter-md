Markdown is a widely used lightweight [[Markup Language]] for formatting text using a plain-text editor. This means nearly every text editor can view and edit these files.

To do this, the formatting is done using [[#Markdown Syntax]], which indicates how words and phrases should look. When opening a markdown file (.md) in a supported program, this syntax is interpreted and displayed as formatting. 

But what if I don't have a such program?
The markdown syntax has been made such that it is incredibly easy to read. If you didn't know better, you could easily assume it was simply a stylistic choice.

Markdown is a widely used lightweight [[Markup Language]] for formatting text using a plain-text editor. This means nearly every text editor can view and edit these files.

To do this, the formatting is done using [[#Markdown Syntax]], which indicates how words and phrases should look. When opening a markdown file (.md) in a supported program, this syntax is interpreted and displayed as formatting. 

But what if I don't have a such program?
The markdown syntax has been made such that it is incredibly easy to read. If you didn't know better, you could easily assume it was simply a stylistic choice.

## Markdown Syntax:

#### Headings
	# H1
	 ## H2
	 ### H3
	 etc
The more "#" there are in front, the smaller it becomes.
The less "#" there are in front, the more priority it has. ***Anything*** underneath with a lower priority then the heading will be grouped with it, unless separated by something with a higher *or* equal priority.
#### Paragraphs
blah blah; some text
This is a ***paragraph***; it is separated by a blank line (as seen above).
